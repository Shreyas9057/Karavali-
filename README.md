# NSDC Skill Development - Karavali's Contribution
This repository will serve as a documentation hub for the NSDC project, focusing on the Matrix Multiplication part, with a dedicated section highlighting Karavali's planned contributions.

## Overview
The project is set to focus on efficient matrix multiplication algorithms, and Karavali will be responsible for executing and optimizing this crucial component.

## Karavali's Contribution

### Planned Scope
Karavali's contribution will involve:

1. Developing matrix multiplication functionality from scratch.
2. Implementing optimization techniques to improve performance.
3. Ensuring scalability for matrices of various sizes.

### Objectives

1. Efficiency: Achieve optimal time complexity through well-chosen algorithms.
2. Parallelization: Leverage multi-threading to reduce computation time for large-scale matrices.
3. Scalability: Design the solution to handle matrices of diverse dimensions, ensuring it can support both small and large datasets effectively.

### Planned Approach
1. Algorithm Selection
    Karavali will explore and implement efficient algorithms (e.g., Strassen's algorithm) to enhance the multiplication process.

2. Optimization
    Emphasis will be placed on minimizing computational overhead, optimizing memory usage, and improving overall runtime.

3. Parallel Processing
    Multi-threading techniques will be applied to distribute matrix operations across available processing cores.

### Timeline
Phase 1: Research and design the matrix multiplication algorithm.
Phase 2: Initial implementation of the core algorithm.
Phase 3: Testing, optimization, and performance benchmarking.
Phase 4: Final review and integration.

### Future Updates
Once the implementation begins, this README will be updated with:
